# Water-Access-In-Maij-Ndogo
## overview 
**Our story in Maji Ndogo continues.**
In Maji Ndogo and across the world, access to clean and reliable water sources is a fundamental aspect of daily life.
The data collected on water sources, water collection, and crime in Maji Ndogo provide us with a deeper understanding of the daily life of its inhabitants and the critical role water plays in their lives.
Communities rely heavily on a few primary water sources, most of which are located quite a distance from their homes. Many residents, particularly women and children, spend a significant portion of their day collecting water. This task often involves long walks under the sweltering sun, carrying heavy containers, and waiting in long lines at the water sources. The physical and time demands of this chore can be gruelling, especially for those who must balance it with work and household responsibilities.
Moreover, the reliance on these limited water sources leads to water collection points becoming crowded and sometimes even tense, as people compete for access to this precious resource. Such situations can potentially lead to disputes, and in some cases, escalate into criminal activities.

I propose developing a series of interactive, visually engaging reports using Power BI. These reports will aim to present our data in a
manner that is not only accessible but also compelling, ensuring that the key messages resonate with our stakeholders. Our focus will be on clarity
and impact, ensuring that the information provided drives informed decision-making and strategy formulation.
My goal is to make complex data comprehensible, engaging, and actionable. I believe that by presenting My data in this manner, i will not only inform but also
empower our stakeholders to understand and address the challenges we face in Maji Ndogo.
